### Intro

My name is Mike Smith. I studied Electronic Engineering, then Computer Science from 1993 to 1999. I have been a forex trader since 2001. I was an international high school math teacher from 2008 to 2018. And a teacher in various public/private high schools and unversities from 2001 to 2007 in China, Japan, and Taiwan. I attended ggu.edu, which at that time coexisted near the same building of frbsf.org. I believe this is why I remain so sternly interested in currency values.


### My Passion
I loved teaching math, and I love coding for AI/deep learning. All the things I like to learn maths, programming, AI, and Forex all seem to harmoniously go together like a big jigsaw puzzle, so I am very blessed in life. My data scientist Builds at Lambda School will be focused on forex. Forex is the analysis of Currency Exchange Rates. There are around 195 countries in the world and each one of them needs a currency. My particular focus is the Euro zone currency vs US dollar, i.e., the EURUSD. Developed countries currencies' are rich and complex structures, but I think developing country currencies are equally interesting, as they often experience hyperinflation, and steep orthogonal political adjustments, rather than free market adjustments.
