### Intro

My name is Mike Smith. I studied Electronic Engineering, then Computer Science from 1993 to 1997. I have been a currency analyst hobbyist since 2001. I was an international high school math teacher from 2008 to 2018. And a teacher in various public/private high schools and unversity from 2001 to 2007 in Japan, Taiwan, and China.


### My History

I am still focused on Forex and my data scientist builds will be focused on this topic. Forex is the analysis of Currency Exchange Rates. There are around 195 countries in the world and each one of them needs a currency. My particular focus is the Euro zone currency vs US dollar, this is also known as the EURUSD.
